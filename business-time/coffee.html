        <h1>Ten Steps to Your Cup</h1>
            Step 1 - Planting<br>
            Despite popular belief, a coffee bean is not a bean at all! It's a seed!The seeds are planted
             during the wet season so that the soil stays moist while roots grow. Coffee trees take years to produce fruit!<br>
            Step 2 - Harvesting<br>
            When the fruit, called a coffee cherry, finally does grow, it is harvested by hand or machine.<br>
            Step 3 - Processing<br>
            The cherries are dried, skinned, and/or pulped. There are several different methods of completing this step. Then, the beans are separated by weight. <br>
            Step 4 - Drying<br>
                If the beans were not dried during the processing, they are now dried and bagged. <br><br>
            Step 5 - Milling<br>
            This is where the beans are hulled, polished, graded, sorted, and prepared for export. This
            process is what separates inferior products from non-inferior products. <br><br>
            Step 6 - Exporting<br>
            The beans are loaded up and shipped worldwide. The largest exporters of coffee are Brazil,
             Vietnam, Columbia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Honduras, India, Uganda, Mexico,and Guatemala.<br><br>
            Step 7 - Cupping (tasting) <br>
            What a great job to have! Experts called "cuppers" visually inspect, smell, and taste the product to ensure quality. <br>
            Step 8 - Roasting <br>
            Green coffee beans are roasted and become the brown beans all coffee enthusiasts are 
            familiar with! Fun fact, the longer beans are roasted (i.e. dark roast) the less caffiene they
            contain. In other words, light roast has more caffiene!<br>
            Step 9 - Grinding<br>
            Grind, course, and everything in between.  The type of grind depends on the type of machine
            or brewing method desired. The length of time the grinds will be in contact with water is the key to what type of coffee grinding is best. The finer the grind, the more quickly the coffee
            should be brewed (i.e. espresso).<br><br>
            Step 10 - Brewing<br>
            This is where coffee enthusiasts have the opportunty to get in on the fun! Good quality beans, freshness, the grind, brewing time, and even the water are all key to the perfect cup.
